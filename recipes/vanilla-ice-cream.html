        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This is a simple recipe anyone can make at home. It features
            minimal ingredients but don't let that fool you! You'll be
            surprised how <em>amazing</em> it will be after we prepare it.</p>
        
        <p>Though it tastes spectacular just as is, we can serve it with:
            <ul>
                <li>Syrups. Some good ones are chocolate, caramel, and even some fruit sauce</li>
                <li>It goes great with some minced chocolate and berries</li>
                <li>Hell, you can even get an ice cream cone or better yet, a waffle cone!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>2.25 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>0.75 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teasponns vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir milk, cream and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until sugar
                has dissolved. Heat just unti the mixture is hot and a small ring of
                foam appears around the edge.</li>
            <li>Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large
                measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at
                least 2 hours. (Overnight is best)</li>
            <li>Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the
                machine, and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25
                minutes</li>
            <li>When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of
                plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place in the freezer to
                ripen, 2 to 3 hours.
            </li>
        </ol>
