This is my first project with html, idea by The Odin Project

I have been following their foundation course for about a week now and I have reached up to the point where simple html projects now possible, along with knowledge of bash, git and github!

This project contains 3 recipes, namely:
1. Vanilla Ice Cream
2. Simple Macaroni and Cheese
3. Grilled Cheese Sandwich

The only real thing holding this mini project back was that it was built only with html, so it looks clunky.
